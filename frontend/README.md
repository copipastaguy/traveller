## Traveller Social Application

### Problem Statement:

`Often times when your friends are overseas, they will update you on the vacation. This creates a hassle to download an image or entering different chats to get updates from your friends. Getting a centralised place to receive updates can reduce the hassle.`

Project progress will be tracked with Notion but is not public as of now.
